# Development hell

*Abandon hope all ye who enter here.* - Dante interviewed about this repository.

In Hollywood, there's a thing called [Development hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_hell). It's when a movie gets stashed for a while (eventually forever) even after people worked on it.

This is my personal GitHub Hell. In this repo, you will find many things that either don't deserve their own repository or that are incomplete, forgotten, useless, but still not worthy of being deleted. The projects are categorized by programming language and it's my biggest hope that one day, I'll finally manage to give them all the love they deserve.

If, by chance or mistake, I manage to complete any of these forgotten pieces of terrible software, it will be posted in its own repository. Until then, they will be rotting in here.

Man, if you find something useful in this barren wasteland, just take it.
